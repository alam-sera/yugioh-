Search for yugioh cards and view their images, details, and current prices on amazon, cardmarket, ebay, and tcgplayer.

I used the yugioh API (https://ygoprodeck.com/api-guide/) to populate most of the card data. The API  does not allow for linking directly to their images so I downloaded the images locally to render them
